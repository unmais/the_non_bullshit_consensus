# the_non_bullshit_consensus
A bit of (anti) politics for a fair and reasonable world. If you are here, it means you also feel that thing.

Below I offer a code of conduct that you could also use in your projects for easier, less non-sensical and safer work.

It's aimed to be guarantee (as far as it's feasible) a fair, reasonable way of conducting the project free of both politics, prejudices, hijack attempts and above all bullshit. 

It's compatible, non-conflicting with almost any reasonable code of conduct imaginable and can be extended in any way you want.
