# the_non_nonsense_consensus
A bit of rethinking behavior patterns in the FLOSS community for a fair and reasonable world. If you are here, it means you also feel that thing.

Below I offer a code of conduct that I deem reasonable for preventing certain endemic problems that make FLOSS projects fail.

Feel free to use adopt it if it's your thing. It's compatible, non-conflicting with almost any reasonable code of conduct imaginable and can be extended in any way you want.

(WIP - any suggestions?)

 THE NO-NONSENSE TEAM MEMBER CODE OF CONDUCT
 
1) NO-NONSENSE GOALS: enjoy and help making the project succeed. Do not fork unless you really need to. Unite, don't divide.
2) NO-NONSENSE TREATMENT: no project member or contributor shall treat another project member or contributor by criteria based on race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or political views.
3) NO-NONSENSE ADMITTANCE: no person from outside the project shall become a project member or contributor by criteria based on race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or political views.
4) NO-NONSENSE EXPULSION: no project member or contributor shall be expelled from the project by criteria based on race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or political views.
5) NO-NONSENSE AGREEMENT: this code of conduct shall prevail over any other code of conduct, agreements or rules dictating behavior in any project including this code of conduct.
